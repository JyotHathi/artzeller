## Project Overview

This README provides detailed information about an Angular 17 application. It includes instructions for setting up, developing, and deploying the application. Angular 17 is a powerful and modern framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 16.x or later)
- npm (version 8.x or later)
- Angular CLI (version 17.x)

You can check your Node and npm versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal or command prompt.

### Installing Angular CLI

If you haven't installed Angular CLI for Angular 17, you can do so by running:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
